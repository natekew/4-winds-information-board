ESP 32 and Nextion information project

On page-1 the information board displays the time and 2-temperatures from hard wired sensors. 
On page-2 the case temperature is displayed, along with menu options to set the clock and 
change the temperature units.

Thanks to Random Nerd Tutorials for their introduction to programming the Nextion HMI:
